# New York City Taxi and Limousine Commision Trip Record Analysis and Visualization

This project offers an analysis of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commision (TLC) Trip Record dataset from January 1, 2023 to January 31, 2023. The goal is to hone data analysis skills by preprocessing raw data and conducting exploratory and detailed analyses. The programming language used is Python, written in a Jupyter Notebook.

# Framework of the Project
## Business Problem
This project begins with defining the business problem to provide context and explain the necessity of analyzing this dataset.

## Data Preparation
Two raw datasets are used:
1. `NYC TLC Trip Record.csv`
2. `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`

These datasets are preprocessed and integrated for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning
This step removes duplicate data, handles missing value, zero values, negative values, eliminates outliers, and resolves data anomalies. Each column is formatted to suit the analysis needs. The cleaned data is saved as `NYC TLC Trip Record Cleaned.csv`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA explores the cleaned dataset to better understand the data available in each column and uncover general pattern and trends.

## Customer Preference Analysis
This section focuses on analyzing passenger preferences, especially tipping behavior, when using NYC TLC taxi services.

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation between tip amount to other features is tested with hyphotesting test, to identify which factor has significance effect to tip amount.

## Conclusion
Insights from the analysis are summarized, highlighting the key findings and their implications.

## Recommendation
Actionable advice is proposed to address the business problem defined at the start of the project. These recommendations are based on the analysis and aim to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.

# Visualization
Visualizations created for this project are also available on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCTLCTripRecordAnalysisDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for better insight and storytelling.
